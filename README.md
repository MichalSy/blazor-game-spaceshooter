# POC - Spaceshooter (Game with Blazor Wasm)
This is a POC with which I wanted to test how performant a game can be programmed with Blazor. For this purpose, a "mini" engine was built that was similar to Unity. All elements in the game are own Blazor components and are added or removed to the DOM in real time.
<br><br>
I have no rights to any of the images I used. The images serve only as placeholders. If the owner of the pictures has objections, I will remove them again. This means that the images may not be used any other way.
