# POC - Outfit Designer (with Blazor Wasm)
This is a POC for an outfit designer, I developed this to test how good Blazor Wasm works by now.


I have no rights to any of the images I used. The images serve only as placeholders. If the owner of the pictures has objections, I will remove them again. This means that the images may not be used any other way.
